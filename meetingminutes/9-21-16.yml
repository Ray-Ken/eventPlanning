Notes: Discussed project ideas with Professor Hartloff. He informed us that
SQLite can use python if we want. We deiscused setting the server up, and 
using flask for the framework. Professor Harloff told us about the server
located in the lab at Baldy 19 that would be operational soon. 
We didnt have any major issues, so we spent the majority of the time 
brainstorming app features to include sharing location (on/off, ping),
meeting up for craigslist deals, use as a semester long event for office
hours, templates for large events like a sport's season, rate attendees in 
addition to events, using google maps in our app.
