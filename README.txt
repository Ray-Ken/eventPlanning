Trouble shooting

It won't work.
LEAF only works on Android 7.0 and higher. Older versions, and non-android
phones cannot run LEAF.

I can't add my friend.
Friends are added by their username, not by their actual name. Also, ensure
that your spelling is correct and they have an account on LEAF.

Won’t Install On Phone.
If the app won’t install directly from the phone’s web browser, go to your phone’s download folder and find the apk and install.
The Phone also need to have “Install from Unknown Sources” enabled.
